3. How JavaScript relates to HTML & CSS

## 0. Video Lectures

This week you'll get to know another experienced teacher, that you'll learn from more closely in the next module. His name is Wilgert Velinga, and he'll teach you all about `functions` and `scope`: [Videos 21 - 25]

## 1. Functions

In programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task. This is useful, because then we can reuse that block of code whenever we need to perform the task again.

In JavaScript, we call these blocks of code `functions`. They are written like this:

```js
function multiplyTwoNumbers(number1, number2) {
  return number1 * number2;
}
```

This example is a `function definition`; a function is being defined. Let's examine it closer.

The first word, `function`, is a keyword, that indicates that what will follow is a function definition. The word `multiplyTwoNumbers` is the name of the function, that will be referred to when the function needs to be executed.

> Note: This is a common pattern you'll find across different programming languages. It's usually necessary to specify what type of data you are going to create, before creating it. This is necessary because the computer cannot guess how they should treat any piece of information. It would the same as, before you ask a question to someone, you would say: QUESTION, what is a function? Saying QUESTION before you ask a question informs the interpreting party (i.e. the person you're talking to) that what you just said is a question. In human communication that's usually not necessary, but it is when communicating with computers.

The words `number1` and `number2` are called `parameters`: they work as a temporary placeholder that will be replaced with real data.

You can liken it to how in a restaurant a table is reserved for customers. The moment the customers arrive the placeholders will be removed and the seats will be filled by the actual customers.

The moment a function is given an input, the parameters are replaced by that input. Each input is called an `argument`.

When used in software, a function is like a black box that:

1. Receives an input
2. Performs an operation on the input (inside the box)
3. Produces an output.

A function is used as follows:

```js
multiplyTwoNumbers(2, 4);
```

You refer to the function name, give it arguments (which are either supplied by some other code or created on the spot) and get back an output. The output is also called the `return value`, the information you get next to the `return` keyword.

As a developer you either use pre-defined functions (usually called `methods`) or create your own in order to make certain tasks happen. Within a function block (which is everything between the `{ }`, there are instructions that tell it in what ways it should manipulate and change the input in order to produce a desired output.

You should see it like this: a function is like a `tool` in the tool box. Only, instead of a hammer or a screwdriver you have a function that multiplies two numbers, or a function that transform data from one data type to another.

## 2. Thinking like a programmer I

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

1. You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen
2. You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)

The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

## 3. How JavaScript relates to HTML & CSS

Consider the following analogy. The human body needs 3 essential parts in order to function appropriately: bones, skin and muscles. The bones are necessary to give the body **structure**. The skin (shape of body, hair, clothing, make up) is necessary to give the body a unique **presentation**. and the muscles (for walking, climbing, swimming) are needed to give the body **movement and interactivity**.

This is exactly how HTML, CSS and JavaScript relate to each other:

- HTML is used to put the structure of a website together
- CSS acts like the skin and makeup for the HTML. CSS improves the colors and layout of a website structure built with HTML
- JavaScript is a full-on programming language that adds interactivity and functionality to a website

Each technology has their own file type: `.html`, `.css` and `.js`. The HTML file is always the base, the other files (whether CSS or JavaScript) are then referenced to inside of this HTML file. HTML is the base, because that's the first file a browser will render. That's just how browsers work!

CSS files are referenced to inside of the `<head>` tag. This is done using the following HTML tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
```

JavaScript files are referenced to inside of either the `<head>` or `<body>`. They are referenced to using the following HTML tag:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
```

It's better practice to reference inside of the `<body>`. This is because the bigger the JavaScript files are (and the more complicated the logic) the longer it will take before a page loads. A browser first reads at the `<head>` before it renders elements on the screen (taken from the `<body>`).
